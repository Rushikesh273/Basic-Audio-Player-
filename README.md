1.Basic Audio Player (Java)
This is my first Java project and first project overall, created for learning purposes.
The project is a Basic Audio Player built using Java AWT and the javax.sound.sampled package. It focuses on understanding GUI programming, event handling, and audio playback in Java.

 2.Features
- Simple GUI using AWT
- Play audio files using javax.sound.sampled
- Event handling for user interactions
- Basic error handling

3.Technologies Used
- Java  
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)  
- Java Package -> javax.sound.sampled 
- Git & GitHub
- VS code IDE 

4.Learning Resources & Approach
- Referred to Bro Code’s Java Audio Player tutorial to understand basic audio playback and for source code

- Applied AWT Frames and Event Handling concepts learned during coursework
- Used AI tools like perplexity and chatgpt to understand, modify, and improve parts of the code
- Learned version control using Git & GitHub

5.How to Run
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Rushikesh273/Basic-Audio-Player-.git
-Open the project folder in any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code)
-Place the audio (.wav) file in the same folder as Main.java
